### Iframe Protection.

There are some security concerns tho...Lets check!!!

Suppose you have a website a.com and we embedded some ad or something from outside domain like b.com or ads.com. Check below example:

<img width="293" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bc2673a-26b0-44bd-978f-0b22e1939dec">

What are the things are may go wrong:

What if b.com can able to access the a.com's resources then it will be critical..!!! or it can be able to temport the content of a.com then also it will be a security breach. To ensure that they will be working with isolation we need to take care of a lot of things.
