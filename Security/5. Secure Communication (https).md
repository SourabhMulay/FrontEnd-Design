### Secure Communication (HTTPS).

Why we said Https is more secure than http. We'll understand the benifits of https!!!!

1. Data Encryption:(TLS)
   The data get transfered over the TLS (Transport layer security).It ensure the data transfered from client to server is not accessable in between.

2. Authentication:(SSL)
    The certification has been shared or the trust has been defined between client and server. The certificate has been provided to client when there is connection betn server to client and certificate is provided by ssl.

3. Data Integrity:(MAC)
   Data you shared in between is not manipulated/tempared.Internally it uses MAC (Message authentication code).

4. Protection against phishing.
   Mostly phishing site have http rather then https and most of secure sites use https.
