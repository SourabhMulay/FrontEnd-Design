#### XSS:
**Cross site scripting: How to avoid?? What is it??**

suppose you have your website called "mango.com", If some hacker can able to inject piece of code or script from outside (externally from n number of places) and the hacker can able to stole the confidential information then you just fucked up. Now website current user is a victim, The data of that user is no more secure.(Account details and credentials are no longer secure now).User session hijacking (your cookie got leaked).

**Vulnarabilities:**

  1.User session hijacking: (Like the cookie got leaked)
  2.UnAuthorised activiy :
  3.capturing Keystrokes: (Somehas has injected a script to know what you are typing)
  4.Stealing critical Information: (Capturing DOM directly)
  5.Phishing attack:

**With XSS these vulnarabilities might be direct threat to your secured data.**
